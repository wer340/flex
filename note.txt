important point about thing flex   every direct child will become a column 
even if that means there will be some overflow that mean we can get some horizental
scroll
whereas grid that wont realy give you that problem by default beacuse when trun it on
nothing happen this is because well with  
a flex container display flex default here is flex direction of row that mean 
the parent is a row so the main axis is the row and 
flex-direction: row;
that means all the children inside of it becoming columns
grid-auto-flow: column;
thats the opposite behavior that we have in grid where the deafult behavior 
is a grid auto flow 
if prevent over flow use   
flex  --> flex-wrap: wrap;
grid --> grid-template-columns: repeat(4,1fr);or  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
