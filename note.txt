important point about thing flex   every direct child will become a column 
even if that means there will be some overflow that mean we can get some horizental
scroll
whereas grid that wont realy give you that problem by default beacuse when trun it on
nothing happen this is because well with  
a flex container display flex default here is flex direction of row that mean 
the parent is a row so the main axis is the row and 
flex-direction: row;
that means all the children inside of it becoming columns
grid-auto-flow: column;
thats the opposite behavior that we have in grid where the deafult behavior 
is a grid auto flow 

if prevent over flow use   
flex  --> flex-wrap: wrap;
grid --> grid-template-columns: repeat(4,1fr);or  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr

actually have flexbox creating a two-dimensional layout in a way up here and then here we have grid also
making a two dimensional layout  they are doing it different ways    they have different constraints in different
ways that they are creating this but its important to know that flexbox can wrap and flexbox can do what what we think  of
as a two dimensional layout  whats important with this is its the way that we can control that layout that is one-dimensional 
way we can think about that too is each one of ✅these rows is independant from next one , row independent from the row above it 
its independent from the row below it 
grid does not work that way  grid is setting things up in a two dimensional grid   so the columns they are locked in this one
only has this little short word in it  but that column is stretching to match the other columns around it  
✅grid a little bit more structured and flexbox is little more flexible 
flex  its come intrinsic sizing of element relying on intrisic sizing but grid  relying struct size parent 
in flex  i cant actually do alot of more work parent div   for making alot of changing in style  of flex method
i have to come children element   div > *{} 
grid sys   relay on struct parent 
flex sys  relay on intrinsic elmnent sizing
flexbox cleaarly when we want this intrinsic sizing of things is just so wonderful and  we just have these items that we want
to go next to each other if ones  bigger ones smaller we want to keep those sizing flexbox is just wonderful
grid on the other hand we can use in ways and im not even going to get into like the big scale layout beacuse often for large
scale layouts its wonderful  it suitable for rigid layout
